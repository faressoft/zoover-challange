## Test in Postman

Open Postman. Click on import (CMD+O). Choose "Import From Link". Enter the collection url. Have fun !

## Configurations ðŸŽ‰

* The app is configurable in `app/config/config.json`.
* PM2 configurations are in `process.config.js`.

## Data Model

* The data is loaded and cached in memory.
* The accommodations are indexed by their ids for quick access.
* The reviews are indexed by their traveledWith attribute for quick filteration.
* An index is built to speedup the calculation of the averages by keeping a record that consists of reviewsCount, reviewsSummation for each rating aspect indexed by years.

## Cool Things ðŸ˜€

* DI module.
* Router module.
* API versioning.
* Core modules loading desing pattern `load()`.
* The `require()` is only allowed in `app.js` check the comment in `app.js`.
* Params Schema (Check `app/config/config.json`).
* More types of middlewares (before, service, controller, after, fail).
* Fully documented code, have fun reading it ðŸ˜€.
* A middleware to separate the validation from the services' code.
* Run a cluster of the app via PM2, configured in `app/config/config.json`.

## Bad Things ðŸ˜“

* I used the minimal parts of a framework that I built from around 3 years. Some parts of the code need a revamp since they have bad implementation, consistency, naming, documentation like `router.js`, `response.js`, `tasks.js`, `helpers/validate.js`, etc.

# Getting Started
